Stockflow was built using Rails for the backend, Postgresql for the database, and React for the frontend. Intra-day and Historical stock prices were provided by IEX. Search API was provided by Alphavantage. News for business and news for each stock was provided by News API. Recharts was used to create charts for the dashboard and stock show page. React Odometer was used to add animation effect to numbers.

1. Multi-page sign up form
2. search existing companies
3. hover over chart to view prices

Multi-Page sign-up form:
This was one of the first and most important difficulties I faced when creating my app. I was still unfamiliar with how a components internal state works and when it decides to re-render. 

Future features:
1. Buy/sell virtual company stock
2. Add/remove company to watchlist
